# How To Provide Liquidity To 0xNODES Strategies

Providing liquidity in the form of native assets on the 0xNODES platform will earn you native asset rewards. In addition to these rewards, you will be able to withdraw your full principal.

0xNODES has one or more investment [strategies](native-strategies.md) available on each chain. Browse the available strategies on the [system11.0xnodes.io](https://system11.0xnodes.io) website to select a strategy to invest in. Note that each strategy is chain-specific, meaning that it accepts the chain’s native assets and rewards the chain’s native asset.

To enter a strategy and earn rewards, connect your wallet to the chain on which the strategy resides. Deposit your native assets into the 0xNODES kernel. Next, invest by selecting and entering the strategy. Once you enter strategy, the system takes care of the rest. Yield builds and your rewards will be updated every time the 0xNODES platform performs a [yield harvest](yield-harvest-and-distribution.md). Your principal and any yield can later be [withdrawn](how-to-withdraw-funds.md).

The blockchain network will charge a gas fee for token approvals, kernel deposits, withdrawals, and entering or exiting a strategy. The kernel covers the cost of all other operations, therefore subsidizing or significantly reducing the amount of gas and other fees that is typically required to participate in yield farming. For example, for a user to directly provide liquidity to three farms on Uniswap, the user would first need to execute three token swaps (incurring swap fees and gas costs), deposit their liquidity into three farms (gas costs), and stake the LP tokens three times (more gas costs). Beyond gas and swap fees, the user would also experience significant opportunity costs in the form of time: they would need to conduct significant research to identify the best liquidity pools, keep watch of APYs, and manually move their assets into optimal pools over time. 0xNODES takes care of all of this for you.
