# 0xNODES Strategies: Earn Native Assets

On 0xNODES, users provide liquidity in the form of the native asset to earn native asset rewards. For example, an Ethereum user stakes ETH (or WETH) and earns ETH rewards.

More specifically, users stake their native assets into curated 0xNODES “strategies”. Strategies, which exist on six Blockchains, are the underlying DeFi protocol integrations of 0xNODES.

Users deposit funds into one or more strategies. 0x\_NODES strategies expose the user to a diversified investment. Each 0x\_NODES strategy deploys funds into multiple high-performing liquidity pools on an automated market maker (AMM), such as Uniswap. 0x\_NODES strategies are multiple-farm (often “3-farm”) strategies, meaning that each user’s funds are split and deployed into multiple liquidity pools.
