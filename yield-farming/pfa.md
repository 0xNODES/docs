# Stake BIOS: Earn Native Assets

Stake the 0xNODES platform token, $BIOS, on any chain to earn native asset rewards on that chain. For example, connect to the Ethereum network to stake $BIOS and earn $ETH rewards.

To deposit the $BIOS, first connect your wallet to the chain where your $BIOS resides. Click the Deposit button on the system11.0xnodes.io website (link), specify your deposit amount, and approve access to your $BIOS. Then, deposit the $BIOS into the kernel. Note that you can deposit $BIOS and the chain’s native asset at the same time.

Users who stake $BIOS earn new rewards every time the protocol harvests yield. On a chain-by-chain basis, the protocol’s yield-harvesting processor periodically harvests and liquidates yield accrued from 0xNODES strategies. A portion of the yield collected from every strategy harvested on a chain is rewarded to users who stake $BIOS on that chain (see Yield Distribution). Each user’s rewards are proportional to their share of the total amount of $BIOS staked on that chain.

$$
Native Asset Yield = \\ StrategyYield * StrategyPFAWeight * (\frac{BIOS Staked By User}{Total BIOS Staked})
$$

The [BIOS token](https://0xnodes.io/bios) is available on every chain supported by 0xNODES. At the time of writing, BIOS can be purchased on Uniswap (Ethereum), SushiSwap (Ethereum), PancakeSwap (Binance Smart Chain), QuickSwap (Polygon), and Hermes (Metis). Users can also [bridge BIOS across chains](../moving-bios-between-chains/how-to-move-your-bios-to-the-polygon-network.md) using a 3rd-party protocol such as MultiChain.
