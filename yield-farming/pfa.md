# Stake BIOS: Earn Native Assets

Users can stake the 0x\_NODES token, $BIOS, on any chain to earn native asset rewards. For example, an Ethereum user who stakes $BIOS will earn $ETH rewards.

Users who stake $BIOS earn new rewards every time the protocol harvests yield. On a chain-by-chain basis, the protocol’s yield-harvesting processor periodically harvests and liquidates yield accrued from 0x\_NODES strategies. A portion of the yield collected from every strategy harvested on a chain is rewarded to users who stake BIOS on that chain (see Yield Distribution). Each user’s rewards are proportional to the share of $BIOS they have staked on that chain.

The [BIOS token](https://0xnodes.io/bios) is available on every chain supported by 0x\_NODES. At the time of writing, BIOS can be purchased on Uniswap (Ethereum), SushiSwap (Ethereum), PancakeSwap (Binance Smart Chain), QuickSwap (Polygon), and Hermes (Metis). Users can also [bridge BIOS across chains](../moving-bios-between-chains/how-to-move-your-bios-to-the-polygon-network.md) using a 3rd-party protocol such as MultiChain (see documentation).
