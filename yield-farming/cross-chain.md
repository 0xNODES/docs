# 0x\_NODES is Cross Chain

The 0x\_NODES protocol is deployed to multiple blockchains. On any chain supported by 0x\_NODES, users can stake $BIOS or provide liquidity in the form of native assets to earn native assets.

0x\_NODES is implementing new technology, InterConnects, that streamlines cross-chain movement of assets.
