# Vault Factories

New vault factory technology is implemented on the Metis Andromeda network and will soon be available on all chains. Users receive a standard ERC-20 token as a receipt for liquidity added to a strategy. To remove liquidity from a strategy, the user must redeem this token.&#x20;

With this move to token-based accounting, the user's strategy position is is now fungible, transferable, and has the same properties and abilities of a standard ERC-20 token.&#x20;
