# How To Withdraw Funds

To withdraw assets, first connect your wallet to the chain where your assets reside. Then withdraw your assets from the kernel into your wallet. Your native assets and $BIOS that exist in the kernel can be withdrawn at the same time with a single transaction. When conducting a withdrawal, you will need to approve access to your wallet.

To withdraw native assets that are currently invested in strategy, first exit strategy. When you exit the strategy, you can move some or all of your native assets into the kernel. Once your funds are in the kernel, you can choose to withdraw funds into your wallet or to re-invest the funds into another strategy.

To withdraw [$BIOS that have been staked](../yield-farming-earn-native-assets/pfa.md), simply withdraw the assets from the kernel. This will automatically unstake your $BIOS and transfer them to your wallet. Make sure you are connected to the appropriate network. For example, if your $BIOS is staked on Ethereum, connect your wallet to the Ethereum network.
