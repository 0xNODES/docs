# How to Earn Rewards

At its core, 0xNODES is a cross chain yield aggregation protocol. You deposit your assets into the system and can choose from various methods of earning rewards.

To earn rewards, do one or both of the following:

1. Stake the $BIOS token on the 0xNODES platform
2. Provide liquidity to the 0xNODES strategies

### Quick Start: Staking $BIOS

Stake the $BIOS token on the 0xNODES platform to earn native assets on the chain where your $BIOS is staked. For example, connect to the Ethereum network to stake $BIOS and earn $ETH rewards.

To stake BIOS, follow these steps:

1. Connect your wallet to the chain where your $BIOS resides.
2. Click the Deposit button on [system11.0xnodes.io](https://system11.0xnodes.io), specify your deposit amount, and approve access to your $BIOS.&#x20;
3. Finally, deposit the $BIOS into the kernel. You will now earn new rewards every time the 0xNODES protocol processes yield.&#x20;

### Quick Start: Providing Liquidity

Deposit native assets on the 0xNODES platform to earn native asset rewards without risks of impermanent loss. For example, deposit ETH into a strategy and you will get back your full principal plus rewards in ETH.

To provide liquidity, follow these steps:

1. Browse the available strategies on [system11.0xnodes.io](https://system11.0xnodes.io) to select a strategy to invest in. Each strategy is chain-specific, meaning that it accepts the chain’s native assets and rewards the chain’s native asset.
2. Connect your wallet to the chain on which the strategy resides.
3. Deposit the native asset of that chain into the 0xNODES kernel.
4. Invest by selecting and entering the strategy. Once you enter strategy, the system takes care of the rest. Yield builds and your rewards will be updated every time the 0xNODES processes yield. Your principal and any yield can be [withdrawn](how-to-withdraw-funds.md).
